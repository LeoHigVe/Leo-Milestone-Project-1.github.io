# Leo-Milestone-Project-1

## Description

This is a little farm game where you can relax and just drag and drop seeds and grow/sell flowers.
My inspiration for this game is Stardew Valley, which is a game that was developed by one person and was 
able to grow such a cult following, and its one of my favorite games.

## Deployment
