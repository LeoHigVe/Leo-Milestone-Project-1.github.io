# Leo-Milestone-Project-1

## Description

This is a little farm game where you can relax and just drag and drop seeds and grow/sell flowers.
My inspiration for this game is 'Stardew Valley', which is a game that was developed by one person and was
able to grow such a cult following, and its one of my favorite games.

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at (<https://leo-mp3.github.io/Leo-Milestone-Project-1.github.io/>).

## Game Logic

Instructions: 

Click on items in the inventory to select/equip them.
Watering can will grow Seeds into Saplings and Saplings into flowers.
The Seed Bag will hold your seeds that are visible on the top right.
The Scythe will harvest the flowers and give you seeds and coins.
To use items click on them and click on a tile on the Farmland
